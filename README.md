Replace this readme with your own information about your project. 

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

## The problem

"Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?"

I can't really come up with a problem on top of my mind but generally I approached problems by googling. After speaking to a couple of friends that work as either frontend developers or backend developers they say that a very important skill is knowing how to google properly and more often than not you can a solution to your problem by using the various developer sites that exist.

If there were problems I did not find a solution on I often asked my friends or looked through technigo stackoverflow or the on-call-support in slack but generally I felt like the problems I had was not very big problems and often fixed by adding or removing something from my code. 

I started off by making a Figma sketch to get a picture of how I wanted it to look I felt like I spent abit too much time on planning, Don't get me wrong was nice having a very good plan but I felt like I went way to much into small details that made me spend less time coding and more time on design which is not the point of this course in my opinion.

If I had more time I would probably have made my code abit cleaner and probably added more javascript and made it more "real" in that sense, I dabbed in alittle javascript in this project and I was thinking of using more than I did but I felt I did not know enough about Javascript to be able to fix the problems that could occur if I used more. I would also have focused more on design if I had more time as I have a background in UX/UI design I feel like I didn't really think anything about design this time around and that hurts my soul a little, But for me this time was to finish the assignment and if I would have time over I would focus more on design, unfortunately this time around I did not have time to focus on design.
